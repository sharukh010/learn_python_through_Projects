### **Main Components of the Code**

1. **`main()` function**
2. **`chatbot(username)` function**

### **Detailed Explanation**

#### **1. `main()` function:**

- **Purpose:** This function initializes the chatbot by setting a username and welcoming the user. It then calls the `chatbot(username)` function to begin the interaction.
  
- **Working:**
  - A `username` is defined as `"sharukh"`. 
  - It prints a welcome message for the user.
  - It calls the `chatbot(username)` function and passes the `username` as an argument.

#### **2. `chatbot(username)` function:**

- **Purpose:** This is the core function that runs in a loop, allowing the user to select one of the available options from a menu, or exit the chat.
  
- **Working:**
  
  1. **Infinite loop (`while True`):**
     - The function runs continuously until the user explicitly chooses to exit by entering `'n'`.

  2. **Menu Display:**
     - The `print("#"*30)` line displays a separator made of 30 `#` symbols for visual clarity in the console.
     - The menu is displayed using the next three `print()` statements, which present the available choices for the user.

  3. **User Input for Choice (`request = int(input("Enter your choice: "))`):**
     - The user is prompted to enter their choice, which is then converted to an integer and stored in the `request` variable.

  4. **Handling Choices (Using `match-case`):**
     - The `match-case` statement is used to handle different user inputs. It matches the `request` value and performs actions based on the user's choice.
     
     - **Case 1:** If the user enters `1`, it prints the `username` that was passed as an argument.
     - **Case 2:** If the user enters `2`, a predefined string is printed (specific content irrelevant for explanation).
     - **Case 3:** If the user enters `3`, another predefined string is printed.
     - **Default Case (`case _:`):** If the user enters anything other than `1`, `2`, or `3`, it prints "Invalid option".
  
  5. **Prompting for Continuation (`cont = input("Do you want to continue the chat?[y/n]: ")`):**
     - After executing the chosen case, the user is asked whether they want to continue the chat. If the user enters `'n'`, the loop will break, and the program will exit. 
     - Otherwise, if the user enters any other value, the loop will continue, redisplaying the menu.

  6. **Loop Exit:**
     - If the user chooses to exit (i.e., enters `'n'`), the program prints "Thank you!!" and the loop breaks, ending the chatbot session.

#### **Additional Notes:**

- **Menu Control:** The chatbot gives the user three options to choose from and runs in an infinite loop until the user explicitly decides to quit.
  
- **User Input Handling:** The `match` statement allows the chatbot to determine the appropriate response based on the user's input. If the user enters a number that is not listed in the options, the program handles it gracefully with a default "Invalid option" message.

- **Exit Condition:** The chatbot will only stop running when the user inputs `'n'` in response to the "Do you want to continue?" prompt. Otherwise, the loop will keep repeating.

#### **Summary of Flow:**

1. The user is welcomed by the `main()` function.
2. The chatbot enters a loop where the user is asked to make a selection from the menu.
3. Based on the user's choice, the chatbot will execute a corresponding action.
4. The user is then asked if they want to continue the chat.
5. The loop only exits if the user enters `'n'`. Otherwise, the chatbot continues.

This pattern allows the chatbot to repeatedly interact with the user while offering a simple exit mechanism.

Here are some practice questions based on the concepts of loops, `break` statement, and functions in Python to help you solidify your understanding:

### **Loops in Python**

#### **1. `while` Loop Practice Questions:**

1. **Simple Countdown:**
   Write a `while` loop that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

2. **Sum of Numbers:**
   Write a `while` loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 and prints the result.

3. **Even Numbers:**
   Write a `while` loop to print all the even numbers between 1 and 20.

4. **Guess the Number:**
   Write a program that uses a `while` loop where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 10. The loop should keep running until the correct number is guessed.

5. **Infinite Loop (with Break):**
   Create an infinite `while` loop that keeps asking the user to input a number. If the user enters a negative number, use the `break` statement to exit the loop.

#### **2. `for` Loop Practice Questions:**

1. **Print Each Character:**
   Write a `for` loop that iterates over a string and prints each character of the string on a new line.

2. **Sum of List:**
   Write a `for` loop that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers in a list: `[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]`.

3. **Multiplication Table:**
   Write a `for` loop to print the multiplication table of 5 (from 5 × 1 to 5 × 10).

4. **Loop Over Dictionary:**
   Given a dictionary `{"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "cherry": 5}`, write a `for` loop that prints the name of each fruit and its quantity.

5. **Find Maximum in List:**
   Write a `for` loop to find the largest number in the list `[10, 45, 2, 33, 76, 1]`.

### **Break Statement Practice Questions:**

1. **Exit on Special Condition:**
   Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10. Use the `break` statement to exit the loop if the number `5` is reached.

2. **Password Check:**
   Create a `while` loop that asks the user to input a password. If the user enters the correct password (`"password123"`), print "Access Granted" and exit the loop using `break`.

### **Functions in Python**

#### **3. Function Declaration and Function Calling Practice:**

1. **Simple Greeting:**
   Define a function `greet` that takes a parameter `name` and prints `"Hello, <name>!"`. Call the function with different names.

2. **Addition Function:**
   Define a function `add` that takes two parameters and returns their sum. Call the function with different pairs of numbers and print the result.

3. **Factorial Calculation:**
   Write a function `factorial` that takes a number as a parameter and returns its factorial (e.g., `factorial(5)` should return `120`). Use a `while` loop inside the function.

4. **Odd or Even Checker:**
   Define a function `is_even` that takes a number as a parameter and returns `True` if the number is even and `False` if the number is odd. Use this function in a loop to check numbers from 1 to 10.

5. **Power of Number:**
   Write a function `power` that takes two parameters `base` and `exponent`, and returns the result of raising the base to the exponent. (Hint: `base**exponent`)

6. **Temperature Converter:**
   Create a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit` that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. Use the formula `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`.

---

### **Advanced Practice Questions (Combining Loops and Functions)**

1. **Prime Number Checker:**
   Write a function `is_prime` that takes a number as a parameter and returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. Use a `for` loop to check divisibility.

2. **Fibonacci Series:**
   Write a function `fibonacci` that prints the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci series, where `n` is passed as an argument to the function. Use a `while` loop inside the function.

3. **Sum of Digits:**
   Write a function `sum_of_digits` that takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits. For example, `sum_of_digits(123)` should return `6` (1 + 2 + 3).

4. **Check for Palindrome:**
   Write a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), and `False` otherwise. Use a `for` loop to check this.

5. **Count Vowels in a String:**
   Write a function `count_vowels` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) present in the string. Use a `for` loop inside the function to count the vowels.

### **Conclusion:**

These practice questions are designed to help you work through the concepts of loops (`while`, `for`, and `break`), as well as function declaration and function calling in Python. Each question progressively builds on these concepts to strengthen your programming skills.

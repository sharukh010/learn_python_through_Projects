### Explanation of the Python Code

#### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Getting Input from the User:**
   ```python
   a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
   ```
   - This line prompts the user to enter the first number (`a`). The `input()` function takes the user input as a string. The `int()` function converts this input string into an integer so that arithmetic operations can be performed.

   ```python
   op = input("Enter the operator (+,/,*,-): ")
   ```
   - This line prompts the user to enter an arithmetic operator (`op`). The `input()` function captures the user's input as a string.

   ```python
   b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))
   ```
   - This line prompts the user to enter the second number (`b`). The `input()` function takes the input as a string, and `int()` converts it to an integer.

2. **Using the `match` Statement:**
   The `match` statement checks the value of the `op` variable (operator entered by the user) and executes the corresponding code block based on the case that matches the operator.

   ```python
   match op:
   ```
   - This line initiates a `match` statement to compare the value of `op` with different possible cases.

3. **Performing Operations Based on the Operator:**

   - **Case for Addition (`+`):**
     ```python
     case '+':
         print(f"{a} + {b} = {a+b}")
     ```
     If the user enters `+` as the operator, the program calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and prints the result using an f-string for formatted output.

   - **Case for Subtraction (`-`):**
     ```python
     case '-':
         print(f"{a} - {b} = {a-b}")
     ```
     If the user enters `-`, the program subtracts `b` from `a` and prints the result.

   - **Case for Multiplication (`*`):**
     ```python
     case '*':
         print(f"{a} * {b} = {a*b}")
     ```
     If the user enters `*`, the program multiplies `a` and `b` and prints the result.

   - **Case for Division (`/`):**
     ```python
     case '/':
         if b == 0:
             print("Cannot divide with zero")
         else:
             print(f"{a} / {b} = {a/b}")
     ```
     If the user enters `/`, the program checks if `b` is zero to avoid division by zero. If `b` is zero, it prints a message "Cannot divide with zero". Otherwise, it performs the division `a / b` and prints the result.

   - **Default Case (`_`):**
     ```python
     case _:
         print(f"{op} is an invalid operator")
     ```
     The underscore (`_`) is the default case, which matches any value not explicitly handled by the other cases. If the user enters an invalid operator (anything other than `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), the program prints a message indicating that the operator is invalid.

#### Summary of How the Code Works:
1. The program asks the user for two numbers and an operator.
2. It uses the `match` statement to determine which arithmetic operation to perform.
3. The program performs the operation based on the user's input or handles invalid input gracefully.
4. The result of the operation or an appropriate message is displayed to the user.

#### Example Output:

1. **Valid Addition Input:**
   ```
   Enter the value of a: 5
   Enter the operator (+,/,*,-): +
   Enter the value of b: 3
   5 + 3 = 8
   ```

2. **Invalid Operator Input:**
   ```
   Enter the value of a: 10
   Enter the operator (+,/,*,-): &
   Enter the value of b: 2
   & is an invalid operator
   ```

3. **Division by Zero Input:**
   ```
   Enter the value of a: 9
   Enter the operator (+,/,*,-): /
   Enter the value of b: 0
   Cannot divide with zero
   ```

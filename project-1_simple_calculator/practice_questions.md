# Practice Programs for Python Concepts

#### 1. **Variables and Data Types**
- **Program 1:** Create variables to store your name, age, height, and whether you are a student or not. Print the values of all variables.
  ```python
  # Example Output:
  # Name: Alice
  # Age: 25
  # Height: 5.6
  # Is Student: True
  ```

- **Program 2:** Write a program to convert an integer to a string and vice versa. Print both before and after conversion.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Integer: 100
  # Example Output:
  # As String: "100"
  # As Integer: 100
  ```

#### 2. **Arithmetic Operators**
- **Program 1:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and displays their sum, difference, product, division, modulus, and exponentiation.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter first number: 8
  # Enter second number: 3
  # Example Output:
  # Sum: 11
  # Difference: 5
  # Product: 24
  # Division: 2.67
  # Modulus: 2
  # Exponentiation: 512
  ```

- **Program 2:** Create a program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius as input from the user.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter the radius of the circle: 7
  # Example Output:
  # Area: 153.94
  ```

#### 3. **Input and Output**
- **Program 1:** Write a program that takes the user's name, age, and favorite color as input and displays a personalized greeting.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Name: Alice
  # Age: 25
  # Favorite Color: Blue
  # Example Output:
  # Hello Alice! You are 25 years old and your favorite color is Blue.
  ```

- **Program 2:** Create a program that asks the user for the current year and their birth year, then calculates and displays their age.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Current year: 2024
  # Birth year: 1990
  # Example Output:
  # You are 34 years old.
  ```

#### 4. **Typecasting**
- **Program 1:** Write a program that takes two inputs from the user (a string and a float), converts them to an integer and a string respectively, and displays both values.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter a string representing a number: "12.34"
  # Enter a float: 56.78
  # Example Output:
  # Integer value: 12
  # String value: "56.78"
  ```

- **Program 2:** Create a program that asks the user for a decimal number and converts it to an integer and a string, displaying all three forms.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter a decimal number: 45.67
  # Example Output:
  # Original number: 45.67
  # Integer form: 45
  # String form: "45.67"
  ```

#### 5. **Relational Operators**
- **Program 1:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input and checks whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter first number: 5
  # Enter second number: 10
  # Example Output:
  # 5 is less than 10
  ```

- **Program 2:** Create a program that checks whether an entered number is even or odd using relational and arithmetic operators.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter a number: 7
  # Example Output:
  # 7 is an odd number.
  ```

#### 6. **Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `match`)**
- **Program 1:** Write a program that asks the user for a score (0-100) and prints the corresponding grade:
  - A: 90-100
  - B: 80-89
  - C: 70-79
  - D: 60-69
  - F: < 60
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter your score: 85
  # Example Output:
  # Your grade is B.
  ```

- **Program 2:** Create a simple calculator using `if-else` statements, similar to the example provided but without using the `match` statement.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter first number: 10
  # Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
  # Enter second number: 5
  # Example Output:
  # 10 * 5 = 50
  ```

- **Program 3:** Modify the calculator program provided to include the `match` statement to handle various operations (+, -, *, /) and print a message if an invalid operator is entered.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter the value of a: 10
  # Enter the operator (+, /, *, -): /
  # Enter the value of b: 0
  # Example Output:
  # Cannot divide with zero
  ```

#### 7. **Advanced Practice**
- **Program 1:** Write a program that simulates a simple ticket booking system:
  - Takes the number of tickets as input.
  - If the number of tickets is greater than 5, apply a 10% discount.
  - Calculate the total cost (e.g., each ticket costs $20).
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Number of tickets: 6
  # Example Output:
  # Total cost after discount: $108.0
  ```

- **Program 2:** Create a program that asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 7 and prints the corresponding day of the week using the `match` statement.
  ```python
  # Example Input:
  # Enter a number (1-7): 3
  # Example Output:
  # Wednesday
  ```

These practice programs cover various fundamental concepts of Python, allowing you to reinforce your understanding through hands-on coding.
